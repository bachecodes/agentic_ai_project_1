The University Policy Agent is an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers student questions using official university policy documents. 
The system retrieves relevant policy information, generates an initial response using a Maker agent, verifies it with a Checker agent,
refines the response if necessary, and applies safety controls to ensure reliability and responsible behavior.
